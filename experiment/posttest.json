      "question": "After deleting a file in an NTFS file system, how can you still recover its content?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By using the file's last access date",
        "b": "By restoring the file from the Recycle Bin",
        "c": "By locating the $DATA attribute in the Master File Table (MFT)",
        "d": "By running a disk defragmentation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The last access date does not contain the file content.",
        "b": "Once permanently deleted, the file is not in the Recycle Bin.",
        "c": "Correct. The $DATA attribute in the MFT still holds the file content even after deletion. ",
        "d": "Disk defragmentation is unrelated to file recovery."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "What is a key forensic use of the Alternate Data Streams (ADS) in an NTFS file system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the speed of file access",
        "b": "To hide additional data or malicious content within a file",
        "c": "To compress files automatically",
        "d": "To store file permissions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "ADS is not used to speed up file access.",
        "b": "Correct. ADS can be used to hide additional data, including malicious content, within a file, making it a significant area of interest in forensic analysis. ",
        "c": "ADS does not handle file compression.",
        "d": "File permissions are not stored in ADS."

    {
      "question": "What is the importance of extracting the Master File Table (MFT) from a file system image during forensic analysis?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To identify suspicious files and track file activity",
        "b": "To format the drive for future use",
        "c": "To increase the size of the file system",
        "d": "To reduce the number of files on the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The MFT helps forensic analysts identify suspicious files, track file activity, and recover deleted files by examining various attributes.",
        "c": "The MFT does not increase the size of the file system.",
        "d": "The MFT does not reduce the number of files."
