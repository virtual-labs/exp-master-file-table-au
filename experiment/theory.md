## Theory

MFT is analogous to a Library directory catalogue. It contains an entry for every file or directory inside an NTFS volume including the MFT itself. Every update that happens on a file in the file system is reflected in the MFT. If an adversary overwrites the contents of a target file in the hard disk, an examiner can still prove the existence of the file by referring to the MFT. With the help of MFT attributes we can also rule out suspicious files using timestamp anomalies. Several MFT attributes (ADS, EA) were also targeted by malware (such as ZeroAccess trojan, Valak) developers to hide their payloads inside them. The goal of this experiment is to introduce students to Master file table, recover a deleted resident fileâ€™s content, & Alternate Data Streams.
