      "question": "What is the primary role of the Master File Table (MFT) in the NTFS file system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To manage network connections",
        "b": "To store and track every file and directory on an NTFS volume",
        "c": "To encrypt files",
        "d": "To manage system memory"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The MFT is not involved in managing network connections.",
        "b": "Correct. The MFT contains an entry for every file or directory on an NTFS volume, acting as a directory catalog. ",
        "c": "File encryption is not the primary role of the MFT.",
        "d": "System memory management is not handled by the MFT."

      "question": "Which type of data is typically stored in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in an NTFS file system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "File metadata",
        "b": "Large media files",
        "c": "Hidden or additional data associated with a file",
        "d": "Operating system files"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Metadata is usually stored in specific attributes, not in ADS.",
        "b": "Large media files are stored as regular files, not in ADS.",
        "c": "Correct. ADS can store hidden or additional data linked to a file, often used to hide malicious content. ",
        "d": "Operating system files are typically stored as standard files."

      "question": "What does the $DATA attribute in an MFT entry represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The security settings of the file",
        "b": "The actual content of the file",
        "c": "The file's creation date",
        "d": "The file's access permissions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Security settings are not stored in the $DATA attribute.",
        "b": "Correct. The $DATA attribute contains the actual content of the file, whether resident or non-resident. ",
        "c": "Creation date is stored in a different attribute, not $DATA.",
        "d": "Access permissions are also stored in a different attribute."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "512 bytes is not the standard size of an MFT record.",
        "b": "2048 bytes is larger than the typical size of an MFT record.",
        "c": "Correct. The standard size of an MFT record is 1024 bytes (1 KB).",
        "d": "4096 bytes refers to common cluster size, not MFT record size."

      "question": "What section of an MFT record may contain unused space called 'record slack'?",

        "a": "Header",
        "b": "Attributes",
        "c": "Record Slack",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The header stores structural metadata, not slack space.",
        "b": "Attributes store detailed metadata and data, not slack.",
        "c": "Correct. Record slack is the unused portion of the 1 KB MFT record after storing the header and attributes.",
        "d": "Record slack is a defined section in an MFT record."

    {
      "question": "What differentiates a resident file from a non-resident file in NTFS?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Resident files are stored externally, non-resident files are stored in MFT.",
        "b": "Resident files are system files, non-resident are user files.",
        "c": "Resident files fit within the MFT record, while non-resident files are stored outside the MFT.",
        "d": "Resident files are encrypted by default, non-resident are not."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is the opposite. Resident files are stored inside the MFT.",
        "b": "File type (system/user) does not determine residency.",
        "c": "Correct. Resident files fit within the MFT record, while larger, non-resident files are stored outside with pointers in the MFT.",
        "d": "Residency has nothing to do with encryption."
