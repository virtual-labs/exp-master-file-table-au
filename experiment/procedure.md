<h3> Procedure</h3>

The Master File Table (MFT) is a crucial component of the NTFS (New Technology File System) used by Windows. It serves as a database that stores detailed metadata about every file and directory on an NTFS volume, including file names, sizes, permissions, and timestamps. Each file or directory is assigned a unique entry in the MFT, which contains both system and user data. The MFT allows the NTFS file system to quickly locate and manage files. It is essential for file operations, including creating, reading, and writing files.

<h4> Steps</h4>

1. **To initiate the simulation, click the Outlook button to open the Outlook interface on the computer.**

5. **Upon opening PowerShell, the VBScript will execute automatically, creating a desktop.ini file. To proceed with the next command, select "Execute." To view the location of the desktop.ini file in the Master File Table (MFT), choose "Show MFT."**

6. **After clicking the Execute button, the system will execute the subsequent command, which writes the text "hjfkhdfbdbfkdfkd" to the file located at desktop.ini.**

7. **After clicking the execute button, the system will download the shellcode from a URL using wget and append the shellcode to the Alternate Data Stream (ADS) of the desktop.ini file.**

<h4> Steps</h4>

**Master File Table**

1. **Clicking the "Show MFT View" button will display the MFT Table view on the left side, with corresponding instructions on the right side. The instruction panel will include a "Go to Simulation" button, which will navigate to the real-time simulation currently being conducted with Outlook.**
